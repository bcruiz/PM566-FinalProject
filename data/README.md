AQI Data Set
==================

'ad_viz_plotval_data' in csv format from the EPA website (https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data) for daily AQI data. The website has a query where I selected State = 'California', Pollutant = 'PM2.5', and with all testing sites in the state. I noticed that the EPA website's API for downloading the raw daily data was not as accurate and did not report the daily data only in intervals of 3 days.

US Census Data Set
==================

'cc-est2019-alldata-06' is our csv file data set from the US Census website (https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-detail.html) and selecting 'California' as our state of interest. This can be found underneath the second body with the 'Population Estimates by Age, Sex, and Race'.

The pdf file 'cc-est2019-alldata' is the file breakdown from the raw dataset downloaded from the website. It includes a full description of each variable and its characteristics of how they were classified such as Age and Year.

Simply download the file folder and its contents under your working directory.
